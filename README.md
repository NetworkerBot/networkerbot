## Welcome to Quora Answers site

Millions of users update their questions and another million users answer these. This site consist of as subset of answers to the questions answered by myself. 

### Motivation

Content creation has become very easy, making it visible is becoming tougher day by day. There are content organisers which have social network aspect, giving them an edge in attracting top content writers and readers. Algorithms are becoming sophisticated to the user's activity, and profiles them. What if tomorrow 

- This content organiser is shutdown
- Changes its policies and practices
- Taken over by someone who runs it differently

As I started this project, there was such a takedown of a very renowned social networking site. Being held hostage by a platform is detrimental to creativity. And losing your contents created over years, by spending time is like losing hard earned money. Time spent is more costlier to buy later.

### What to expect?

Questions and Answers to those questions. The questions were asked by Quora users and the answers where created by me over years. I had collected those answers and made a automated website hosted by Github. Like the saying goes, putting my eggs in multiple baskets. Without any more rambling lets head to [Contents](https://networkerbot.github.io/networkerbot/contents) that you might find interesting and engaging.
