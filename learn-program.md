To learn anything effectively, we humans need effective feedback. It is this “Feedback” that differs among person to person or even machines(Case of ML / AI). In AI it is called Reinforced Learning.
Like any good Learning Agent, you have to first ask,
Where do good programmers get their feedback from?
They get their feedback as they Type their Code on the system. It never bores a programmer to see the letters populate the screen as he goes on typing the code logic. 3It is like drawing art, writing music for the programmer. Most good programmers know to touch typing so they can easily enter into a flow state. While many amateur programmers hate typing, and lose interest mainly because they can TYPE Fluently. (But not all those good at touch typing are good programmers!!!)
Next feedback comes from the results when the program executes the way he or she intended.
How do Programmer know whether their program worked the way they intended?
Testing. Yep they use existing testing fixture to test their code as they develop. Many programmers first write the test cases they have to pass, and then start writing the program. They develop with the end their mind.
You don’t need to write tests for your programs. That is where competitive programming websites and their automated judges comes into picture. We will delve in it later.
Another option is starting to create visualisation of the patterns that you want through programming. Most the problems in this world can be visualised into a pattern. If you can program the pattern, then you can solve the problem.
The above points are just the beginning, but you are asking again…
How to get effective feedback while learning to Program?
And decide, It is simple,
This where the feedback loop breaks, leads most of the “would have been” awesome programmers to quit. Let me explain.
When you run your program, the computer can do many things like
^ Sit quietly in a loop
^ Hang there for you input without asking you
^ Spit out an error that is cryptic
^ Output that is totally different from what you imagined or visualised
and it goes on depending on the programming language, the operating system and your logic.
Too many types of outputs, and these outputs may or may not be helpful feedbacks.
Okay, we see the root cause of the problem. What to do about it? Yep that is a positive question.
Finally, here are the steps to take and reach the Programmer Flow State…
Step 1: Decide the programming language you want to learn
Step 2: Buy a book that introduces you the language at the basic level
Step 3: Set up your computer environment, so you can run the programs in that language. (Spend time on this at the beginning, since this is major deal breaker in anyone trying to learn programming)
Step 4: Read the chapters in the book…(Next is the twist) At the same time get a Typing Tutor for your OS, and learn to “TOUCH TYPE”.
Step 5: Type the examples the book has given in your computer and execute it. You SHOULD TYPE EVERY CHARACTER of the program. Cut / Copy / Paste is the worst thing to be used by a would be programmer.
Step 6: Try correcting and executing the examples until you can get the feedback the example has shown in the book.
Step 7: Learn a Versioning program like Git or SVN. The code you type needs to be there for your later review. The moment you start coding, your system might crash, or the laptop may not be available. If you use the versioning system, then you can pull your code anytime, anywhere. That makes you feel powerful.
Step 8: Complete the book at any cost, even if it takes an YEAR or TWO. (If you dedicatedly start typing the code the longest book can be completed in 3 months) You see Touch Typing plays a huge role.
Step 9: The book will usually have exercises. Solve these problems on paper,
There might be a solution key that you can download to cross check.
Last bullet point in Step 9 can lead to frustrations. I say frustrating because, the moment you see the key, you find the author has masterfully written the program and your code looks lousy. Checking code yourself becomes tough, demoralising. It need not be. (That is where Online Judges help. They only show whether your answer is write or wrong. After that, no hints, no clues or shared. It is up to you to find the solution)
By the time you complete step 9, you must have read the book twice and read most of the program examples multiple times. Pat yourself on your back.
Step 10: Go out in the wild wild Internet and read as many programs in the language you are learning.
Step 11: Collect programming snippets that repeat often in these programs. Then use them multiple times in your daily activities. The more you use, faster you will familiarize.
Step 12: Search for good Competitive Programming book that introduces you to the problems in increasing complexity, and make sure the book either uses online judge or some fast feedback providing tool.
You can also search for Visualization programming books, these are more easier because you can test the visualization with your EYES.
Step 13: Complete the problems listed in the Competitive programming book and ensure all the programs can be executed without error.
By Step 13, you must know about your weakness and strong points more than anyone else. You will also know the language inside out, atleast more outer than inner. Becoming proficient in programming comes after learning effectively.
All the very best for your career. You have chosen a wise path.
